Feynman diagrams are used to show interactions among [[particles]].

They go from the bottom up, It shows how one part (one corner) turns into the top counter part of the corner. They do this via exchanging energy with the other transaction and they exchange this by using the exchange particle shown by the middle.

use [this](https://www.aidansean.com/feynman/) to create the diagrams, And this key to show them accurately.

An example of a Feynman diagram is,

An interesting fact is that the $W^+$ boson going left to right is the same as a $W^-$ boson going right to left.  Why this is the case #only_god_knows.

There are certain Feynman Diagrams which need to be memorised, preferably understood, for the exam.

[[Gauge Bosons]] are exchange (Virtual) particles, this is represented by the wave in the middle of the Feynman diagram.
